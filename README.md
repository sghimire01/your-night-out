# your-night-out

Your Night Out is a group Project done for CSCI-3308 which is a date night application/website hosted on Heroku. It is a node.js application that features:
- HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend
- Google Maps API and MovieGlu API 
- A working login system that utilizes: PostgresSQL database and SQL queries 

The user can signup, choose their favorite types of cuisines, their favorite movie genres, then pick a theatre that features a movie that they might like (along with ratings). The google maps API then shows them a map of how to navigate to the restaurant then the theatre. 

This repo is forked from our final version (private) that we turned in. I coded the working login system with PostgreSQL and Node.js, and helped with the frontend and API calls.
